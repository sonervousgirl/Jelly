			<b>How many accounts can we have? <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1TDTpwQ.png"></b><br>

				<u>UPDATED 2/19/21:</u> Noah is <i>not</i> currently banning users solely for having more than 5 accounts, but the new limit IS a rule. For now, many users are working on consolidating pets down to 5 accounts or as close as possible, to prepare for any future announcements. At this time that is voluntary, and we will keep you updated if there is any further clarification. <br><br>

				<u>UPDATED 2/1/21:</u>You can now only have FIVE total accounts, 1 main and 4 sides. Now that Noah is back, he is banning people who have more than 4, but if you’ve been banned for this, he may give you a chance to appeal and transfer pets!<br><br>

				<u>OLD:</u> We do not have a hard limit on the amount of accounts you can have. However, each account is limited to 4 pets and you should not be using these accounts to hoard names for later profit or to abuse dailies.

			<br><br>

			<b>Can I transfer items from my main account to my sides?</b><br>

				Absolutely! It is fine to send items to your side accounts. Activity between accounts can be monitored so it will be abundantly clear when accounts are being used for less-than-good reasons.<br><br>
				You can also transfer high quality RE finds from your sides to your main. It's not recommended to transfer many small items though, as this can look a lot like funneling items.

			<br><br>

			<b>Will we be able to transfer Neopets?</b><br>

				Yes, that is a feature that will be added to the game, it just is not active quite yet.

			<br><br>	

			<b>Is there a Quick Adopt link for doing adoption transfers?</b><br>

				Yes, there is one currently. Make sure that case and spelling is correct for best application. <br><br>The URL is:<br>https://neopetsclassic.com/adopt_pet/PETNAMEHERE<br><br>
				It is also linked on our Dailies page, and there is a section on our Guides page that details the safest way to transfer pets.

			<b>I found a bug or glitch. How can I report this?</b><br>

				For now, bugs can be reported on the Discord in “Bug-reports” channel, and Noah will handle them as soon as he can. If they are game-breaking in nature or can be exploited by players, please DM him directly with all the details you possibly can so that he can replicate the error and resolve it.<br>Please see the “List of Known Bugs” pinned post in the Bug-reports channel for a list of known issues.

			<br><br>

			<b>How do I make Neopoints?</b><br>

				Neopoints currently are gained from Random Events (REs), scratching or selling Scatchcards, and dailies. Other NPs can be gained from selling restocked items and RE items to other players.<br><br>
				REs have an 8 minute cooldown between each event, so you cannot get another event before that cooldown has expired. The is a guide on maximizing REs on our Guides page.

			<br><br>

			<b>Can I adopt the special character pets from the pound? </b><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1TDTpwQ.png"><br>

				Currently? No.<br>In the future, you will be able to but you might have to rename them. Noah has stated in the past they would need to be renamed but has recently started looking into alternatives, as many players already have these pets on their accounts. If you own a special character pet, it will also be subject to Noah's decision.

			<br><br>	

			<b>What kind of mature topics can be discussed?</b><br>

				NPC does not allow material that is of a vulgar or hateful nature.<br>
				It is OK to state your identity, orientation, mention significant others, and even swear, but it is not OK to share anything explicitly sexual in nature, or any sort of racism, sexism, homophobia, or any other form of hate or bigotry.<br>
				Anything deemed too graphic/hateful will be removed, pet names found to violate these rules are up to Noah’s discretion and may be deleted or have a forced rename.<br>
				We ask that any inappropriate names you may find that break these rules be reported. If you’re posting them in the Discord, please block out the name using a spoiler so the offensive terms aren't shared publicly.

			<br><br>

			<b>When is (insert feature) going to be added?</b><br>

 				There is no ETA on any of the future features to be added to NPC. At this time, Noah will let the player base know when something is coming up. Features such as flash game revamps and the Battledome are further off goals. The focus for now is implementing basic, fundamental updates to make the basic content available to players.

 			<br><br>

			<b>Is the lab map active?</b><br>

				Yes, you can get the pieces from random events. The lab works the same as on Retail Neopets and so far seems to give identical results.

			<br><br>

		<h1>Are there...?<br></h1><br>

			<b>transmog potions?</b><br>

				Recently active! They have started dropping from random events, and Noah says we should have even more species added soon

			<b>guilds?</b><br>

 				Not yet, but they have been mentioned.

 			<br><br>

 			<b>games?</b><br>

 				HTML games are queued up, flash games will much longer bc it’s harder to do.

 			<br><br>

 			<b>Battledome classic?</b><br>

 				 Not yet, it’s a huge/long project that’s far off.

  			<br><br>	

 			<b>ways to upgrade your bank account?</b><br>

  				Not currently, Noah is aware of it though.

  			<br><br>
