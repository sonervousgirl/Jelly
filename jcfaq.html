		<h2>Site FAQ</h2>

		<h1>Jellyclassic FAQ<br></h1><br>

			<b>Where do you get your information?</b><br>

				Mostly through first hand experience on the site and speaking with other players. We try to bring you official data and new whenever possible.

			<br><br>	

			<b>Are the Secret Laboratory Map prices accurate?</b><br>

 				The Lab Map has been constantly in flux since before New Years. We try to keep it accurate and will upsdate as often as possible, but the prices can vary widely day to day based on the current state of REs.

  			<br><br>	

			<b>Do you have another question for us?</b><br>
				Use the contact link at the bottom of the page to submit any questions or concerns directly.
